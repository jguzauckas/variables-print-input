#In this assignment, you will create a "fake" conversation with the computer
#The program will continually respond to what you say and ask pre-programmed questions
#The responses will incorporate your answers to sound more "realistic"

#For example:
#Computer: "Hello, what is your name?"
#You: "Mr. G"
#Computer: "Hi Mr. G, I am the computer, how old are you?"
#You: "24"
#Computer: "Ah, 24 is a great age..."

#Requirements:
# - Incorporate at least one example of each data type into your inputs (integer, float, boolean, string)
#   - Since bool feels like an odd one out, treat it like a True/False question!
