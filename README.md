This repository is designed to outline the basics of variable declarations and usage, print statement options and syntax, and effective use of inputs.

Each component has two files with similar names. One is a markdown file (`.md`) and the other is a Python file (`.py`).

The markdown file has formatted notes describing concepts and talking about sample code. All of the sample code snippets are found in the Python file for you to be able to run, and modify.

The recommended order for information is:

1. variables
2. print
3. input

Once you've gone through those notes and code samples, try the classwork.py file, which offers some problems for you to program a solution for!

To check your work, my own solution to the classwork is provided in classworkcompleted.py.

Finally, give homework.py a try with some additional problems!
