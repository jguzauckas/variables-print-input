This repository is designed to outline the basics of variable declarations and usage, print statement options and syntax, and effective use of inputs.

As a class, we will go through each of the three informational files together, and after each one, you will fill in a short assignment at the end of the file and commit/push your changes!

When we've gotten through all of the content, you will work on the classwork.py file, which prompts you to utilize your new skills. As a reference, I have a sample solution in the classworkcompleted.py if you ever get stuck. Make sure to commit and push your code!

After class, there is a homework assignment in homework.py for you to complete similar to the classwork. Make sure to commit and push your code!
